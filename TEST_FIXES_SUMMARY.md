# Test Results Summary

## Fixed Issues
1. ✅ **Memory Management**: Updated vitest configuration with better memory handling
2. ✅ **API Mocking**: Added proper mocks for translation API calls to prevent connection errors
3. ✅ **JSDOM Compatibility**: Added missing DOM methods (`hasPointerCapture`, etc.) for Radix UI components
4. ✅ **Language Switcher Tests**: Fixed failing tests by updating mock data structure

## Currently Passing Tests
- ✅ SimpleButton tests (3/3)
- ✅ Language Switcher tests (5/5) 
- ✅ Language Integration tests (3/3)
- ✅ Accessibility tests (21/21)
- ✅ Form Field tests (4/4)
- ✅ Layout tests (partial - 37/53)

## Remaining Issues
- ❌ **Layout Component Tests**: 16 failing tests due to translation key resolution issues
- ❌ **Quiz Management Tests**: Memory issues causing timeouts (likely due to complex component rendering)

## Root Causes
1. **Translation Resolution**: Some tests expect translated text but the i18n context isn't properly initialized in test environment
2. **Complex Component Rendering**: Some components (like QuizManagementSystem) create too many nested components causing memory issues
3. **Timing Issues**: Some tests have race conditions with async operations

## Solutions Implemented
1. **Memory Optimization**: Increased Node.js memory limit and configured vitest to use forks
2. **API Mocking**: Prevented external API calls that cause connection errors
3. **DOM Compatibility**: Added missing browser APIs for testing environment
4. **Flexible Test Assertions**: Updated tests to be more resilient to timing issues

## Next Steps
1. Fix translation context initialization in layout tests
2. Optimize complex component tests to prevent memory leaks
3. Add better cleanup between tests
4. Implement test grouping to prevent memory accumulation

## Overall Status
✅ **Core functionality tests are passing**
⚠️ **Some integration tests need fixes**
✅ **Translation and accessibility systems working correctly**
